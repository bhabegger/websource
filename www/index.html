    <h1>WebSource : a generic application access to the web </h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is WebSource ?</h2>
    <p>
      WebSource is a perl module abstracting application access to data available on the Web and
      accessible via a set of dynamically managed web pages. This means posting a query via an
      HTTP server, fetching the set of pages and extracting the relevant pieces of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      It defines a set of generic operators which when correctly parameterized and
      combined together allow to define a specific web extraction task. The
      task can be describe in an XML language called WetDL (for Web
      Extraction Task Description Language).
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a WetDL description (a wsd file), the perl script ws-query by
      using the WebSource library allows to execute tasks such as querying
      Google, extracting country information from the CIA World Fact Book, etc.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How does it work ?</h2>
    <p>
      There are different elements of an extraction process which are specific
      to the task :
      <ul>
	<li>the parameters of the query and the access method to use</li>
	<li>the part of a result page pointing to the next result page</li>
	<li>the parts of the page containing the effective results</li>
	<li>the structure of the results</li>
      </ul>
      WebSource works by taking a description of these elements and does
      the rest. It takes as input such a description and a query to the
      source (with the source specific parameters), sends the query to
      the HTTP server, retrieves the first result page, extracts the
      results and the link to the next result pages, fetches that other
      page, extracts the new results and the new link,... until it
      cannot find another link to a next page of results.
    </p>
    
    <h2 id="getting">Where can I get it ? </h2>
    <p>
       It is available either via cvs or from the project page on
       sourceforge.
    </p>
    <p>
      New releases are made available from the project page :
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/websource/">
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/websource/
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Different parts of WebSource are also available on the anonymous
      sourceforge cvs server. To checkout a given module just type the
      following (just give an empty password when asked for one) :
      <pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/websource login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/websource co modulename
      </pre>
      
      The available modules are the following :
      <ul>
        <li><b>main</b> : contains the WebSource perl modules and scripts</li>
        <li><b>www</b>  : the websource.sourceforge.net web site pages (ie. this site)</li>
        <li><b>desc</b> : a set of example description files
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How do I install the module ?</h2>
    <p>
      Get and decompress the archive, do a usal
      <pre>
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
      </pre>
      You can add a <tt>make test</tt> between the last two lines but it
      only does a 'use' test for the moment.
    </p>

    <h2>How do a use a Web Source description ?</h2>
    <p>
      First you need to make such a description accessible from your system.
      The -s option of ws-query can take either a local filename or a URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you need to see which parameters the description takes (take a look
      at the &lt;ws:options&gt; element in the wsd file). Then you can execute
      the task with your parameters with ws-query.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Where can I find wsd files ?</h2>
    <p>Some example wsd files are available from the WebSource cvs server.
      (See the <a href="#getting">Where do I get WebSource</a> section).
    </p>
    
    <h2>How do I make a perl script making use of the library ?</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest way to get started is by typing the following example
      perl script using the module allowing to query Google (by using the
      google.wsd file) :
      <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use WebSource;

# Give a WebSource description URI
my $wsd = "/path/to/google.wsd";

# Build a WebSource instance
my $ws = WebSource->new(wsd => $wsd);

# Setup your query
my $query = join("+",@ARGV);

$ws->set_query(q => $query);
# Note : the format of the query is source dependant (for Google the
# only element we want to be user-defined is the actual google query "q"
# element )

# Retreive the results and print them out
while(my $res = $ws->next_result()) {
   print $res , "\n";
}

# Note : all of the results could have been fetched into an array by
# doing
#    @res = $ws->query(q => $query)
# but this meant waiting for all the result pages being downloaded and
# all the ressults extracted
# set_query and next_result use a lazy method so a page is downloaded
# and its results extracted only when needed
      </pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Where do I get more information ?</h2>
    <p>
      For more information you can consult the man pages of the
      project. You can start from the WebSource man page. The each type of
      operator is implemented as perl module which each have their man page.
      For example, the fetch operator is implemented by the WebSource::Fetcher
      module whose man page can be accessed via <tt>man WebSource::Fetcher</tt>.

      For continuous information on the evolution of the project a sourceforge mailing list
      named websource-info is available (see the websource amiling list page :
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=126716">
        http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=126716
      </a>).

      You can also send an email my sourceforge email address habegger _at_ users.sf.net.

    <h2>Who initiated the project ?</h2>

      Well I did. That means Benjamin Habegger. I have just finished my Phd in
      Computer Science at the University of Nantes in the

      and am currently working with the <a href="http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/">Grappa</a>
      research team in Lille. You can get more
      information about me, my research and teaching on my home page :

    <h2>How can I contribute ?</h2>
    <p>
      You can contribute to this small project by suggesting ideas,
      code, and new description files by writing me an email.
