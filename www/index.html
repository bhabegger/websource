    <h1>WebSource : a generic application access to the web </h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>What is WebSource ?</h2>
    <div>
      WebSource is a perl module abstracting application access to
      data available on the Web and accessible via a set of
      dynamically managed web pages. This means posting a query via an
      HTTP server, fetching the set of pages and extracting the
      relevant pieces of information.
    </div>
    
    <h2>How does it work ?</h2>
    <div>
      There are different elements of the process which are specific
      to each source :
      <ul>
	<li>the parameters of the query and the access method to use</li>
	<li>the part of a result page pointing to the next result page</li>
	<li>the parts of the page containing the effective results</li>
	<li>the structure of the results</li>
      </ul>
      WebSource works by taking a description of these elements and does
      the rest. It takes as input such a description and a query to the
      source (with the source specific parameters), sends the query to
      the HTTP serveur, retrieves the first result page, extracts the
      results and the link to the next result pages, fetches that other
      page, extracts the new results and the new link,... until it
      cannot find another link to a next page of results.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Where can I get it ? </h2>
    <div>
      It will soon be made available on the sourceforge cvs.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I install the module ?</h2>
    <div>
      Get and decompress the archive, do a usal
      <tt>perl Makefile.PL</tt>, <tt>make</tt>, <tt>make
	install</tt>. There is no make test since I haven't added
      tests yet.
    </div>

    <h2>How do I get it to work ?</h2>
    The easiest way to get started is by typing the following example
    perl script using the module allowing to query Google (this script
  is available <a href="first.pl">here</a>):
    <pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use WebSource;

# Give a WebSource description URI
my $wsd = "http://wwwsource.free.fr/desc/google.xml";

# Build a WebSource instance
my $ws = WebSource->new(wsd => $wsd);

# Setup your query
my $query = join("+",@ARGV);

$ws->set_query(q => $query);
# Note : the format of the query is source dependant (for Google the
# only element we want to be user-defined is the actual google query "q"
# element )

# Retreive the results and print them out
while(my $res = $ws->next_result()) {
   print $res , "\n";
}

# Note : all of the results could have been fetched into an array by
# doing
#    @res = $ws->query(q => $query)
# but this meant waiting for all the result pages being downloaded and
# all the ressults extracted
# set_query and next_result use a lazy method so a page is downloaded
# and its results extracted only when needed
    </pre>
</div>

  <h2>Where do I get more information ?</h2>
  <div>
      For more information you can consult the man pages of the
      project. There are two packages : WebSource and WebSource::Engine
      which give a bit more detailed information of themselves. You
      can either consult the man pages locally.

      You can also send an email my sourceforge email address habegger _at_
users.sf.net.

      For continuous information on the evolution of the project a
sourceforge mailing list named websource-info is available.
  </div>
  <h2>Who initiated the project ?</h2>
  <div>
    Well I did. That mean Benjamin Habegger. I have just finished my Phd in
    Computer Science at the University of Nantes and am currently working
    with the Grappa research team. You can get more
    information about me, my research and teaching on my home page :

  <h2>How can I contribute ?</h2>
  <div>
    You can contribute to this small project by suggesting ideas,
    code, and new description files by writing me an email.
