WebSource example descriptions
==============================

This repository includes example WebSource description. As of today
(2004-01-02) they are fully functional. 

If you have set up any wsd files yourself, feel free to send them to me
(habegger@users.sf.net) for inclusion in this repository.

Using the descriptions
======================

Here is given a short descrition of the working examples descriptions and
how to make a successful call with ws-query.

* "1001salles.wsd" 
  
  This description allows to query the 1001salles.com web site.
  The query can be parameterized with only one option (-d) which allows
  to set the french departement.

  An example call is :

    ws-query -s 1001salles.wsd -d 44

* "cia-wfb.wsd"

  This description allows to extract from the CIA world fact book, a short
  decription of each country containing the country's name, population and
  coordinates.

  To call this task :

    ws-query -s cia-wfb.wsd

* "fibo.wsd"

  This description calculates the fibonacci sequence starting a given integer.
  It has a single parameter (-n) : the initial number.

  It can be called as follows :

    ws-query -s fibo.wsd -n 1

* "google-service.wsd"

  This description allows to query google using its web service (ie. the
  Google API). It will work provided you replace the string MYGOOGLEKEY by
  you're own key to the google API service or you use the key parameter

  An example call is as follows :

   ws-query -s google-service.wsd -k YOURGOOGLEKEY "XML Web Services"
  
* "wayback.wsd"

  This task allows to query archive.org to obtain an old archived version
  of a web page. With this description, the obtained version is both saved
  to a file in /tmp with a name following the template wayback-XXXXX.html
  and output to the console. The url for which to find the old version is
  given via a "url" (-u) parameter and the year of the version to fetch is
  given via the "year" (-y) parameter.

  Warning : In this description a dummy operator with initial input was
            added. Without this initial input nothing would happen since
            the reception of data by the query operator triggers the
            production of results.

  An example call is the following :

   ws-query -s wayback.wsd -y 2000 -u http://www.grappa.univ-lille3.fr/

* "quotations.wsd"

  This very simple task (just one operator) allows to obtain the soap
  results returned for a given list of stock quote symbols.

  An example call :

    ws-query -s quotations.wsd MDKFF.PK IBM MSFT
